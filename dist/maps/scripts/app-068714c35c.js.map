A purpose can be as simple as to tell a story, or as complex as\\n                solving a societal problem.

The place should be safe and comfortable for the community members to relax and remain for a\\n                while. The nicer the table you set, the more that will come to dinner. The place also must be accessible\\n                to everyone, and this could be the most important to note: A community gathering should never be exclusive,\\n                or have a prohibitive cost or entry to anyone, as it should be inviting and welcoming to all. \\u200B\\n\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <p class=\"lead\" ng-if=\"comm.handle==\\'Health-&-Wellness\\'\">\\n\\n                Community Health and Wellness Camps and its employed and volunteer practitioners, board members, officer, employees or independent\\n                contractors are deemed to be an employee of the City Public Health and Human Services.
